# Week Goals

### Goals
- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### How The Week Went
- Really good fun working as a team and creating something much larger as 5 people are working on the code
- Running standups was also great planning the days work and working out then tackling when we fell behind to make sure we still ended with the MVP and additional user stories
- Learnt loads about using github for branches and merging
- Understanding feedback and giving good feedback to others in the group was also a skill we improved on in working as a team
