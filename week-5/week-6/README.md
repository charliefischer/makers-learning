# Week 6 Goals

### Week Goals
- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### How the week went
- Getting to grips with javascript was good fun! 
- Translating the language was a great method for me as I could fly through codecademy without having to fully read each section as the reasoning behind things was the same for Ruby - it was mostly about recognising the new syntax
- Getting to grips with the new framework of Jasmine was relatively straightforward
- Using jQuery was good as well as I did recognise some of the syntax and was great seeing things happen as you write them in the console log
