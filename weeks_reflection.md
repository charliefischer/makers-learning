# How the week went
I felt this week things definitely ramped up in terms of the amount of learning each day and what we are expected to self learn. 

After a week of working on SQL Zoo I feel much more comfortable working with simple SQL queries and also learnt that more complex queries are relatively easy to work out from Google'ing provided you know how the basic structure of the queries works. 

In terms of building a web app with a database I feel a little lost in terms of if I was to make one again from scratch without any references but I believe if I had my bookmarks as reference that I would be able to work out and can remember what the code does when re-reading it. 

Debugging in database apps I feel much more confident in and also love that you can use p statements throughout you can really pin point exactly where it goes wrong. Also using capybara you can expect to have content which will reveal exactly what content is on the page the rspec is testing to give really clear visibility in the errors. 

In terms of the basics of how databases work - I feel somewhat confident in explaining how they fit into MVC models and how tables work but definitely need some work on getting multiple tables to work together
