# Day 5

## Goals 

### goal 
be able to describe some basic OO principles
### achieve 
work through the resources on github as well as the pills on the teachable dock
### evidence 
be able to accurately explain what some of the principles are and how they're used

## How today went
- I feel much more confident on the basics of OOP
- I wrote up a blog post to jot down my notes on what the 4 main pillars are here: https://charlie-a-fischer.medium.com/week-1-describing-basic-oo-principles-ba971b27e163
- I still would like to work on my RSpec syntax and one liner tests
- as well as my github version control as these are both essential skills
