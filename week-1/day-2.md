# Day 2
## Debugging
- gems allow us to use code made by other people to help us get our solutions easier
- in particular RSpec gem allows us to write tests 
- problems should be solved by breaking down problems into lots of small ones, and writing a test to solve each problem and then writing the code to pass that test
- tackle failed tests one at a time
