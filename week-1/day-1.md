# Day 1

This was more of an introduction to the whole course. 
We covered:
- our responsibilities as learners and being in a cohort
- the escalation process
- when to ask for help
- importance of being okay with not completing work so long as we are learning
- emphasis on knowing why we are solving in a problem in a way as oppose to explaining just what my code is doing
