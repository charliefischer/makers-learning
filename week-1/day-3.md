# Day 3

## Goals 
### goal 
confidence tackling error messages using the  debugging process
### achieve 
run through the debugging pill and the intro to debugging
### evidence 
be able to explain to other people clearly what error messages mean and what to do next

SMART objectives:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable 
- Relevant
- Time bound

There are also two different brain modes when it comes to debugging and writing code
| Find the fix | Find the problem | 
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| solution orinted | learning oriented | 
| try the first thing we see | understand the code before we fix it | 
|     | works better for hard bugs |

## How today went
- getting my head around the syntax of RSpec is tough but feel that once I've got the hang of it it should be easy to apply to my own tests
- feel much more confident with debugging and reading error messages (more knowledgable on what to google if I don't recognise the error)
