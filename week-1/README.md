# Week 1
## Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
## Wider course goals this week should help with (see all course goals here)
### I  can TDD anything
By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.
### I can program fluently
You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.
###  I can debug anything
You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
