# Day 6
## Goals 
### goal 
revise unit tests in isolation using mocking  - in particular how to use doubles
### achieve 
read through the 'testing OO relationships using mocking' on github
### evidence 
be able to go back into my airport project and comfortably update the tests

## Code Reviews 

- Every Monday we'll review each others code from the weekend challenges
- Try to look from an outsiders perspective
- Look at how to improve the code
- Will also improve our ability to write code, read code, explain code and critically evaluate code

## How today went
- still need lots of work on getting to grips with mocking and doubles
- I feel comfortable in knowing when to use doubles (when your test involves instances and methods from other classes to the class youre testing in)
