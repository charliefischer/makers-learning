# Week 2

## Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:
- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.
