# Day 3
## Goals 
### goal 
revise unit tests in isolation using mocking  - in particular how to use doubles (didn't get round to it yesterday)
### achieve 
read through the 'testing OO relationships using mocking' on github
### evidence
be able to go back into my airport project and comfortably update the tests

## How today went
- Most of the day was taken up by the EQ session where we focused on giving feedback to others. 
- I did get a chance to speak to my mentor ALM about doubles and mocking which definitely cleared up lots of my confusion. 
- I know understand better when to use doubles and mocking and that you have to assign everything you need the double to do - it will be born with no functions or values at all
