be able to comfortably explain to someone the principles I've covered as well as refactor previous code using the TDD principles I'll revise/learn

## SOLID
### Single Responsibility
### Open Close
### Liskov Substitution
### Interface Segregation
### Dependency Inversion

## How today went
- fell much more confident on more OOD and TDD
- made a blod post on TDD: https://charlie-a-fischer.medium.com/test-driven-development-f14d234e99fc
- need to look into splitting classes again this is very complicated 
- I should look at old challenges I've done and look at the previous commits so I can see when the tutorials have told us to split classes and how they've done it
