# Day 12
## Goals 
### goal 
continue to get to grips with how the web works and amend my takeaway challenge
### achieve 
watch the videos sean sent in the channel and make notes
### evidence 
go back through what I worked on yesterday afternoon reading my code and the responses and requests and be more comfortable in what I'm reading

## How today went
- felt a little bewildered by the amount of changes to RSpec and using Capybara.
- particularly with RSpec as we had to use the walkthroughs to pass most steps as it was all completely new with no mention of the changes in the hints and resources
- looking forward to getting the game created a bit more so I can go back and hopefully all the steps from today will make more sense
