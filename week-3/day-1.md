# Day 11
## Goals
### goal 
begin to get to grips with a simple web app

attend the workshop and if there is spare time start working through the resources on github
### evidence 
be able to apply this in the afternoon challenge

## Servers
"a piece of hard/software that provides functionality to other programs or devices called 'clients' "

browser -- request --> server
server -- response --> browser

GET requests are used to pull data from a server
POST requests are used to subit data to a server

## HTTP
- within http we call data sent from a client to a server a parameter
- parameters come as key=value pairs
- a request can contain more than one param
- one way of sending a param to a server is to pass it in the query string

## How today went
- looking forward to getting into CSS having done some of that before and making websites look shit hot is what I'd love to do
- little tricky to get my head around using .erb files to store the HTML and CSS as very new to me but definitely interesting
