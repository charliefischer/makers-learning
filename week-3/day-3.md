# Day 13
## Goals 
### goal 
read up more about capybara and rspec
### achieve
https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/blob/master/README.md#using-capybara-with-rspec
### evidence 
feel more confident in afternoon pairing with capybara and rspec

## How today went
- definitley more comfortable with writing RSpec tests using capybara  to simulate how a user would use the site
- really enjoying the battle app 
- currently implemented the attack button so when pressed it confirms the move was made
- went off on lots of tangents during the pairing but felt it was very beneficial and we still got quite far on.
- still want to play around with the background feature of capybara rspec to be able to do some stubing
